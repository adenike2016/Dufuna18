'GET ' means that form data is to be encoded by a browser into a URL 
'POST' means that form data is to appear within a message body.
"GET" method should be used when the form processing is "idempotent", and in those cases only. As a simplification, 
we might say that "GET" is basically for just getting (retrieving) data on the other hand  "POST" may involve anything, 
like storing or updating data, or ordering a product, or sending E-mail.
