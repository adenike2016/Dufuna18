'POST ' means that form data is to be encoded by a browser into a URL 
'GET' means that form data is to appear within a message body.
 "GET" is basically for just getting (retrieving) data on the other hand  "POST" may involve anything, 
like storing or updating data, or ordering a product, or sending E-mail.
In other words, POST hides data,for example when a password is appended to a URL, POST hides the password from a user so it is advisable to use POST when dealing with sensitive data
POST is more secured compared to GET
POST Forms are not cached by browser while GET forms are cached by browser and remains in the browser history as cookies
Data is passed internally through a server in POST while Data is passed through Url in GET
Data length is unlimited in POST while data length is limited in GET
Data is invisible in POST while data is visible in GET
